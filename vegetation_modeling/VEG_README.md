# Files to Run

`veg_by_au_and_mass.py` takes in various argument, and spits out a different `.json` for each planetary mass you have specified. The json has 2 levels, with number one being stellar mass, and number two being semimajor axis. This file relies on 3 others. `constants.py` contains various useful constants such as 1 solar mass in SI units. `veg_utils.py`, calculates a bunch of factors which eventually give us the retained gas fraction from the planet's primordial phase. `atm_mass_frac.py` will take in the planet's parameters, including the retained gas fraction we found, and evolve the planet over time, allowing us to experiment at different points in the planet's life cycle.

`hz_grid.py` takes in a variety of `.json` files that are generated by the aforementioned Python file, and arranges them into a grid throughout the habitable zone (axes being parent star mass and semimajor axis of orbit), showing the level of vegetation we predict for each combination of those two parameters
